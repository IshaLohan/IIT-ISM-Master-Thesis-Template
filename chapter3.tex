\chapter{Method }

Total internal reflection is a phenomenon in optics where light, when traveling from a denser medium to a less dense medium at an angle greater than the critical angle, reflects back into the denser medium rather than refracting out. 

\section{My subsection}

This principle is the basis for optical fibers used in telecommunications.
