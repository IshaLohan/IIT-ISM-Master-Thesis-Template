# IIT-ISM-Master-Thesis-Template
Hi! Want to switch to Latex for your thesis, but not getting a clue how to get started? You are at the right place. I have uploaded tex file of the template for the Master's thesis format at IIT ISM. Just to help out colleagues and upcoming students to save time in formatting as per institute guidelines.
Just collect your science and results and don't panic about margins, fonts or line spacings. :D
This is the very initial file, please let me know if need changes. Thanks!
